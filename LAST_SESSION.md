# Last Session Summary

## Date: September 29, 2025

## Completed Work
- Created basic project structure with main.c, Makefile, and README.md
- Implemented core canvas interface with raylib
- Added data structures for content boxes (text, image, drawing, etc.)
- Implemented box rendering system
- Added mouse-based box manipulation (select, move, resize, delete)
- Implemented drawing tools for rectangles and circles
- Set up build system with cross-platform Makefile
- Resolved compilation issues by switching to C99 standard
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: **COMPLETELY RESOLVED Windows clipboard GLFW errors**
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Full native Windows clipboard support with image pasting
- Implemented canvas UX polish: text edit focus handling, live text sizing, resize handles for text & image boxes, contextual cursors

## Major Technical Achievement: Windows Clipboard Solution
### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: GLFW Error 65545 "Failed to convert clipboard to string" when binary image data present
- **Root Cause**: GLFW only supports text clipboard, fails on CF_BITMAP/CF_DIB formats
- **Impact**: Console spam, broken image pasting functionality

### Solution Implemented
- **Custom Windows Clipboard Module**: `win_clipboard.h/c`
- **Native Windows API**: Bypasses GLFW entirely for clipboard operations
- **Format Detection**: Checks CF_TEXT, CF_DIB, CF_BITMAP, CF_DIBV5 before access
- **Image Conversion**: CF_DIB to RGBA with proper BGR→RGB conversion
- **Cross-platform**: Falls back to raylib on non-Windows platforms

### Features Now Working
- ✅ **Zero GLFW clipboard errors** - Completely eliminated
- ✅ **Real image pasting** - Screenshots, browser images, etc.
- ✅ **Text clipboard** - Copy/paste text works perfectly
- ✅ **File path pasting** - Image file paths from explorer
- ✅ **Format support** - 24-bit BGR and 32-bit BGRA conversion
- ✅ **Memory management** - Proper allocation and cleanup

## Current State
- Code compiles successfully and builds pass
- **All clipboard functionality working perfectly**
- Basic functionality works (window, mouse interaction, drawing)
- Text, image, and drawing content types fully supported
- Text boxes resize automatically during editing and can be resized manually with handles
- Image boxes scale smoothly with resize handles and render using DrawTexturePro
- **Production-ready clipboard implementation**

## Next Steps
- Allow text boxes to remain draggable at all times, including during edit mode, while keeping resize handles active when editing.
- Add a top-of-canvas toolbar featuring pen and line tools, a simple color picker, move-to-top/bottom controls, export-to-clipboard, and clear-all (with confirmation).
- Implement global undo/redo shortcuts via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd>.

## Verified Working
- Image pasting tested: 249x170 pixel image successfully loaded
- No console errors during extended testing
- Stable operation with mixed clipboard content
