# Last Session Summary

## Date: September 29, 2025

## Completed Work
- Created basic project structure with main.c, Makefile, and README.md
- Implemented core canvas interface with raylib
- Added data structures for content boxes (text, image, drawing, etc.)
- Implemented box rendering system
- Added mouse-based box manipulation (select, move, resize, delete)
- Implemented drawing tools for rectangles and circles
- Set up build system with cross-platform Makefile
- Resolved compilation issues by switching to C99 standard
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: **COMPLETELY RESOLVED Windows clipboard GLFW errors**
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Full native Windows clipboard support with image pasting
- Implemented canvas UX polish: text edit focus handling, live text sizing, resize handles for text & image boxes, contextual cursors
- Enabled text boxes to stay draggable while in edit mode, preserving resize handles during inline editing
- Added a top toolbar with select/pen/line/rect/circle tools, color palette, layer ordering controls, export-to-clipboard, clear-all confirmation, and status messaging
- Implemented freehand pen and segment drawing modes with live previews and texture-backed storage
- Introduced snapshot-based undo/redo history with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> covering creation, deletion, transforms, drawing, and clipboard pastes
- Corrected render texture orientation for drawing outputs so released shapes match the live preview
- Fixed toolbar rectangle/circle button mapping by binding buttons to explicit tool identifiers
- Updated rectangle and circle tools to commit outline-only shapes for cleaner canvas composition
- Wired Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y shortcuts (both control keys) to the history stack and finalize active text edits before undo/redo
- Added Ctrl+Shift+Z redo and AZERTY-friendly Ctrl+Z detection with user feedback when history navigation is unavailable

## Major Technical Achievement: Windows Clipboard Solution
### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: GLFW Error 65545 "Failed to convert clipboard to string" when binary image data present
- **Root Cause**: GLFW only supports text clipboard, fails on CF_BITMAP/CF_DIB formats
- **Impact**: Console spam, broken image pasting functionality

### Solution Implemented
- **Custom Windows Clipboard Module**: `win_clipboard.h/c`
- **Native Windows API**: Bypasses GLFW entirely for clipboard operations
- **Format Detection**: Checks CF_TEXT, CF_DIB, CF_BITMAP, CF_DIBV5 before access
- **Image Conversion**: CF_DIB to RGBA with proper BGR→RGB conversion
- **Cross-platform**: Falls back to raylib on non-Windows platforms

### Features Now Working
- ✅ **Zero GLFW clipboard errors** - Completely eliminated
- ✅ **Real image pasting** - Screenshots, browser images, etc.
- ✅ **Text clipboard** - Copy/paste text works perfectly
- ✅ **File path pasting** - Image file paths from explorer
- ✅ **Format support** - 24-bit BGR and 32-bit BGRA conversion
- ✅ **Memory management** - Proper allocation and cleanup

## Current State
- Code compiles successfully and builds pass
- **All clipboard functionality working perfectly**
- Basic functionality works (window, mouse interaction, drawing)
- Text, image, and drawing content types fully supported
- Text boxes resize automatically during editing and can be resized manually with handles
- Image boxes scale smoothly with resize handles and render using DrawTexturePro
- Toolbar exposes drawing tools, color palette, layering controls, export-to-clipboard, and clear-all confirmation
- Undo/redo history stack active with bounded snapshots and full resource restoration
- **Production-ready clipboard implementation**

## Next Steps
- Polish the toolbar experience (hover states, icons, tooltips) and expose undo/redo controls visually.
- Reduce undo/redo snapshot cost by deduplicating textures or capturing diffs for faster history navigation.
- Expand text editing UX (click-to-place caret, range selection, formatting shortcuts).

## Verified Working
- Image pasting tested: 249x170 pixel image successfully loaded
- Undo/redo exercised across text edits, transforms, drawing creation, and clipboard pastes without resource leaks
- Toolbar export-to-clipboard tested; resulting image re-pastes correctly into the canvas
- No console errors during extended testing
- Stable operation with mixed clipboard content
