# Last Session Summary

## Date: September 30, 2025

### Completed Work
- Delivered audio boxes: clipboard path detection, waveform loading, undo-ready persistence, and space/double-click playback toggles with visual status cues.
- Added playback UI styling with dynamic icons, filename display, and resilient fallbacks when the audio device is unavailable.
- Ensured audio boxes render reliably even when playback assets can’t load, including placeholder UI, status messaging, and history restore support.
- Added CF_HDROP clipboard ingestion so Windows file copies paste directly as image, audio, or path boxes with multi-file support.
- Enabled per-text-box font sizing with Ctrl +/−/0 shortcuts, auto-resize, undo/redo integration, and live status feedback.
- Refreshed text node visuals with lime selection outlines, blue editing focus rings, and a caret that tracks font scale.
- Implemented full text selection and caret navigation: mouse placement, drag selection, Shift+Arrow, Home/End, and vertical movement with column memory.
- Rendered selection highlights, auto-selected newly created text boxes, and added Ctrl+A and mouse drag behaviours that feed undo history.
- Added per-text-box color metadata so text nodes default to black and adopt the active palette selection.
- Palette clicks now recolor the active text box in real time and produce undoable history entries.
- Synced TODO checklist with implemented features (smart wrapping, pen/segment tools, shortcuts, layering) to reflect current scope.
- Verified the project builds cleanly via `build.bat` after the updates.
- Preserved trailing spaces and blank lines in text boxes by replacing strtok-based measurement/drawing with allocation-safe helpers.
- Added text clipboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+X/Ctrl+V within edits) and Ctrl+Arrow word navigation so text boxes behave like native editors.
- Cleaned up temporary backup sources and ensured global paste shortcuts no longer interfere while editing text boxes.
- Polished the toolbar with rounded buttons, hover feedback, palette highlights, and active tool indicators.
- Introduced a persistent status bar with contextual hints and audio readiness reporting, and excluded it from exported canvas captures.

### Known Issues

### Next Steps
- Surface font size controls in the toolbar (slider or preset buttons) and preview the active size.
- Provide toolbar typography controls (alignment, weight presets) now that font sizing is adjustable.
- Replace text abbreviations with iconography and optional tooltips to further elevate the toolbar.
- Explore inline transport controls and visualizers for audio boxes, then expand the pipeline to video playback support.
- Implement marquee "box" selection via click-and-drag to select multiple items at once.
- Extend marquee selection to full multi-object workflows (bulk move, layer changes, delete, etc.).

## Previous Session (September 29, 2025)

### Completed Work
- Created basic project structure with `main.c`, `Makefile`, and `README.md`.
- Implemented core canvas interface with raylib, box data structures, rendering, manipulation, and drawing tools.
- Set up the cross-platform build system, switched to the C99 standard, and eliminated compilation issues.
- Delivered a complete native Windows clipboard integration (`win_clipboard.c/h`) supporting text, image, and path formats with no GLFW errors.
- Enhanced canvas UX with inline text editing, resize handles, contextual cursors, toolbar controls (tools, palette, layering, export, clear), and undo/redo shortcuts including AZERTY-friendly bindings.
- Implemented freehand pen and segment drawing with texture-backed storage and corrected render orientation.

### Verified Working
- Image pasting (249x170) validated, undo/redo exercised across all content types, and export-to-clipboard re-import tested successfully.
- Toolbar interactions, drawing tools, and clipboard operations run without console errors or leaks.
